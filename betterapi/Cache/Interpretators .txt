#Slide: 2
#Header: What Is an Interpreter?
#Content: An interpreter is a program that reads and executes code directly. It processes one statement at a time, converting each statement into machine code or bytecode.

#Slide: 3
#Header: How Interpreters Work
#Content: Interpreters execute code through an interpreter loop, which repeatedly reads a statement, evaluates it, and then executes it. The process continues until the program is completed or an error is encountered.

#Slide: 4
#Header: Types of Interpreters
#Content: There are two main types of interpreters: source interpreters, which process source code, and bytecode interpreters, which process bytecode. Examples of popular interpreters include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby.

#Slide: 5
#Header: Advantages of Interpreted Languages
#Content: Interpreted languages offer several advantages, such as being easier to learn, having simpler syntax, and being more versatile. Because they don't compile source code, they can easily execute code on multiple platforms.

#Slide: 6
#Header: Disadvantages of Interpreted Languages
#Content: Despite their advantages, interpreted languages do have some disadvantages. Because they execute code directly, they can be slower than compiled languages. Additionally, they can only catch errors during runtime, rather than during compilation.

#Slide: 7
#Header: When to Use an Interpreter
#Content: Interpreted languages are best suited for rapid application development, prototyping, and small-scale scripting. They are also useful for programs that need to be portable across multiple platforms and systems.

#Slide: 8
#Header: Summary
#Content: An interpreter is a program that reads and executes code directly, offering several advantages such as ease of use, portability, and versatility. However, they can also be slower and have limited error checking. Interpreters are best used for rapid development, small-scale scripting, and portable applications.
