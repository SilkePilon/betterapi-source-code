#Title: Generating a Deno Server

#Slide: 1
#Header: Introduction to Deno
#Content: Deno is a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that provides a modern approach to building server-side applications.

#Slide: 2
#Header: Installation and Setup
#Content: First, we need to make sure Deno is installed on our system. To do this, run the following command in your terminal: "deno --version". If you donâ€™t have Deno installed, you can install it by running: "curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh" or use the pre-built installers.

#Slide: 3
#Header: Creating a New Deno Project
#Content: To create a new Deno project, you need to create a new folder and then create a new file inside it with the ".ts" extension. This will be your main entry file. Then you can run "deno run --allow-net app.ts" to start the server.

#Slide: 4
#Header: Writing the Server Code
#Content: Here's a simple example of how to create a Deno server:

```typescript
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std/http/server.ts";

const server = serve({ port: 8000 });

console.log("Server running on http://localhost:8000/");

for await (const req of server) {
  req.respond({ body: "Hello World\n" });
}
```

#Slide: 5
#Header: Adding Routes
#Content: You can add routes to your Deno server by using a third-party library such as Oak or ABC. Here's an example of how to add a route using Oak:

```typescript
import { Application, Router } from "https://deno.land/x/oak/mod.ts";

const router = new Router();
router.get("/", (ctx) =&gt; {
  ctx.response.body = "Hello World!";
});

const app = new Application();
app.use(router.routes());
app.use(router.allowedMethods());

await app.listen({ port: 8000 });
```

#Slide: 6
#Header: Adding Middleware
#Content: Deno also supports middleware, which are functions that can modify the request or response as it passes through the server. Here's an example of how to add middleware using Oak:

```typescript
import { Application } from "https://deno.land/x/oak/mod.ts";

const app = new Application
