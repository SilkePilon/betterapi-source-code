Based on your preferences, I would recommend the horror movie "Get Out" directed by Jordan Peele. The movie combines elements of horror and social commentary, and has received critical acclaim for its suspenseful plot and thought-provoking themes. Other great horror movies to consider for your film night include "Hereditary," "The Babadook," and "The Witch." Enjoy your movie night!
