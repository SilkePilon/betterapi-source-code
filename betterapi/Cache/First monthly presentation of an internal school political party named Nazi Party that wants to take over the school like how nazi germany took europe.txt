#Content: The current state of the school is worrying. We have witnessed an increase in disrespectful behavior, poor academic performance, and lack of pride and discipline. This should not be allowed to continue.

#Header: Our Solution to These Issues
#Content: The solution to these issues is to implement a strict and rigorous regime that puts the needs and the glory of the Nation above all else. We will achieve this through a combination of discipline, order, education, and propaganda.

We will then create propaganda campaigns to promote our cause and to recruit new members. Finally, we will launch a series of actions to seize control of key positions in the school administration.
