#Header: Introduction to Python
#Content: 
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language used in web development, data science, and more.

#Slide: 3
#Header: Basic Data Types and Operations
#Content: 
Python has several built-in data types like strings, integers, floats, and more. These data types can be manipulated using various operations like arithmetic operations, comparisons, and logical operations.

#Slide: 4
#Header: Control Flow Statements
#Content: 
Python provides several control flow statements like if, else, and loops, which can be used to control the execution of the program based on various conditions.

#Slide: 5
#Header: Functions
#Content: 
Functions in Python allow code to be reused and organized. Python functions can accept arguments, return values, and be recursive.

#Slide: 6
#Header: Working with Files
#Content: 
Python provides a rich set of tools for working with files. Data can be read from and written to files using the file I/O methods.

#Slide: 7
#Header: Object-Oriented Programming in Python
#Content: 
Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP). Classes and objects can be created to represent real-world concepts and to organize related code.

#Slide: 8
#Header: Modules and Packages
#Content: 
Python modules are files containing Python code, while packages are collections of modules. Python modules and packages help to organize code and make it reusable.

#Slide: 9
#Header: Advanced topics in Python
#Content: 
There are several advanced topics to explore in Python, including Regular Expressions, Multi-threading, Networking and more.
