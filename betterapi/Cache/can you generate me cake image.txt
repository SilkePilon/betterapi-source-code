Here's an example of Python code using the Pillow library to generate a simple cake image:

```
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw

# create a blank image that's 1024x1024 pixels
img = Image.new('RGB', (1024, 1024), color='white')

# create a drawing context for the image
draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)

# draw a pink cake layer
draw.rectangle([200, 400, 824, 724], fill='pink', outline='black')

# draw a brown cake layer on top
draw.rectangle([300, 300, 724, 424], fill='brown', outline='black')

# save the image
